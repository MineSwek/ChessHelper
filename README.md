# ChessHelper
(It is an old project) Thanks to this application you can move figures on any chess website using only your voice!

How to use the application:
Firstly you have to set coordinates using first button then left mouse button on the left top corner and bottom right corner of the board.

Then you click the second button and just use your voice to move!
