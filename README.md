# ChessHelper
(It is an old project) Thanks to this application you can move figures on any chess website using only your voice!

How to use the application:
Firstly you have to set coordinates using first button.
After clicking it you will have two buttons to choose. After clicking first you have to click the left top corner of the board.
If you click second one you have to click the bottom right corner of the board.

The calibration is complete!

Now you can click the second button! Choose if you are playing as white or black and just use your voice to move!

This a polish project so You would have to change some variables in code to make it work for your language!
